# RoboCode

In my first elective at TH KÃ¶ln my Partner and I programed a robot which fights against other bots in multiple arenas.

Every programmer get a skeletal structure and fill it with the API from the Robocode founders.
I uploaded my robot, if you want an example maybe for your own robot or just want to see how it works.

You can download everything you need on http://robocode.sourceforge.net/

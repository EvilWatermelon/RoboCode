# RoboCode


Hello guys,

this is EvilWatermelon from TH Köln.
In my first elective at TH Köln my Partner and me programed an AI.
This AI is a little robot, fighting against other robots in a arena.

Every programmer get a skeletal structure and fill it with the API from the Robocode founders.
I uploaded my robot, if you want an example maybe for your own robot or just want to see how it works.

You can download everything you need on http://robocode.sourceforge.net/


Greetings

EvilWatermelon
